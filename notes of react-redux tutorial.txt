Notes of React/Redux tutorial

RUN info: go in the right directory and run: npm run dev
		next step: npm run start to run the server -> open localhost:3000


all states of the application combined into one big javascript object
all the states (coming from diferent object) kept in a same place -> STORE

provider: makes the store available to all the containers
containers (redux + react connection: fetches data from the store and it passes on the component to render)
components (react)

actions:90% actions requested by the user like click,... it can be something internal like some process is about to finish, API data is flowing into the app, etc.
reducer: functions that take an action and decides which part of the store data to change (f.e a reducer called a movie reducer is waiting for an action delete movie and when it happens it deletes part of the state object)


webpack file - it actually sets up a server that converts all of the jsx code into pure js and forwards towards client browser. also the same stands for sass and css 
(basically converts behind the scenes and allows immediate refresh)

- bundle.min.js is automatically generated from the build tool so no need to change it


container - think of it as a component linked to a data storage.. so what it does is it makes a mapping between a functional component and a specific part of the state we want to use. Note that this state has to be declared as a variable inside the combineReducer under reducers->index.js
